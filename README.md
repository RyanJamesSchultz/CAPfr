# CAPfr

I present a Matlab-based enviroment, CAPfr that uses CAP-tests to infer if a maximum magnitude is bounding a catalogue of earthquakes.  This repository is related to a study about the same topic [Schultz et al., 2025].  This repository contains programs, scripts, and data to recreate figures and results of the prior study.  The core tools developed are KS_dM_test.m, M2fit.m, and EnsembleW.m.  See also my prior GitHub repositories for required routines (e.g., Bval.m).
